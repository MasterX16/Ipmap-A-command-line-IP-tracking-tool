# Ipmap

## About 
This is a simple command line tool written in Python that allows geolocation of IP addresses directly from your terminal. It has been tested on Kali Linux only for now, though it should work for Debian-based systems as well as for other Linux-based systems.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasterX16/Ipmap-A-command-line-IP-tracking-tool
cd Ipmap
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
ipmap -h
